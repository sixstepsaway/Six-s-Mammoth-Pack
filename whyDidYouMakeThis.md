# Why did you make this when X pack exists?

Three of my favorite modpacks are: Craft of the Titans, Dungeons & Dragons & Space Shuttles, and The Decursio Project. 

I love the constant threat in **Craft of the Titans**, where no matter how secure my base might be, at any moment a wither clutching a TNT might come running in and ruin *everything*. I find it keeps me constantly on my toes, always trying to make my base better, improve my defenses and weather my way through another hellish night. I like that it tests my ability to actually fight worth a damn (zero, it turns out), and makes everything from building a mob farm to working on a smeltery harder. However, I find it doesn't have quite as much content as I'd like, probably because it's a wonderfully crafted, tightly designed pack with only what it needs and nothing more. 

**Dungeons & Dragons & Space Shuttles** is my favorite long-term pack right now. I love how much stuff it has, how many choices I have when it comes to persuing a project (do I want Refined Storage, XNet or Applied Energestics? Should I work on a Forestry farm or will six Gentle Harvesters do? Should I make a lot of solar panels, or start on some kind of big reactor?) but also how well the quests guide you when you have no idea how to progress. I like how much stuff there is to decorate and build with, as well. I also love that if I don't *want* to quest, I don't have to! You can bypass the quests entirely without losing anything. 

Then there's **The Decursio Project**, which combines all my favorite parts of SevTech with 1.16.5's newer mods like Farmer's Delight. It also has MineColonies, which is - frankly speaking - one of my absolute favorite things to do in Minecraft. I love building a colony. I also love the Sims. I imagine these things are related. Unfortunately it has my least favorite parts of SevTech too, like the Stages system. 

I've never liked hard-coded stages, disliking how it gates progression behind specific quests or achievements. In DD&SS, I played on a server with Wanda where instead of starting in the Overworld, we started in the Twilight Forest. That's pretty fun, all told; after all, TF has less mobs spawning in the daytime and it's absolutely beautiful. The downside is that most of the early DD&SS quests require copper, and copper only spawns in the TF at very high levels - the kind of high levels that are gated by the mod. Determined to not cheat (and to say we were spawned there, even though technically we did have to portal there), we wanted to earn a portal home to go and get copper, but that requires Botania and a diamond. The Botania pieces required a block of iron, which required a bunch of pieces that, unfortunately, *required copper*. 

We ended up taking a whole different path than the usual DD&SS progression and raiding a dragon nest, where we found chests filled with copper. Once I had just enough copper, I could put together an Advanced Crafting Table, which meant I could make a Blacksmith Workbench. *That* meant I could turn nine iron plates into a block without the need for a smeltery, and from there I could make the petal apothecary. It's that kind of thing you can't really do in SevTech, or (as far as I know) in Decursio.

I also like big kitchen sink modpacks. I like variety. I like being able to sink hundreds of hours into one pack without missing out too much on other mods I like.

Finally, one of my all-time favorite modpacks, which I always forget is a modpack I think, because it sits in my head as a game of its own, is Crash Landing. The constant balancing of thirst and temperature while surviving an onslaught of mobs? I love it. But I also like that when I'm chilling with my bestie, we can just fudge the system a little and cheat some extra lives. She used to have terribly slow internet back when Crash Landing was current, and so when she would die because of that internet, it was important for me to be able to get her back in-game: she didn't die fairly. It wasn't fun for us if her internet got slow and she died because of it. 

Thus was born this pack. My original concept was:

- a progression system similar to SevTech but without ages
- a nesty homemaking, colony-building system similar to The Simple Life 2
- thirst/temperature/gravity and air, like Enviromine used to provide
- extra, and scaling, mobs like Titans
- extra animals and fancy animals because I love farming and pets
- 'whatever OceanBlock has goin for it' which wasn't a particularly strong description, but I knew what I meant
- and finally "a skyrim feel, with cities, towns and villages"

I've managed to achieve the skeleton of these things. We have extra and scary mobs, we have MineColonies and architectural mods, we have Survive for thirst and temperature, we have a boatload of animal mods, and we have some options for boats and the like, as well as things to discover beneath the waves. 

The Skyrim feel requires more expansive modding on my side (more than KubeJS can effectively provide), which I intend to do as a way of learning Java, but the rest of it I think I've managed the bare bones of.

Over the time it's taken me to make the pack run and be relatively stable without anything extra thrown into it (custom recipes etc), the concept of the pack has evolved to have somewhat of a storyline. The Overworld is medieval-themed, and there are other dimensions where you can find, loot and steal technology - you just have to get there first.

I hope you'll all join me for this exciting adventure.
